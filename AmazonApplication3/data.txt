Reviewed in India on 17 January 2025

I recently purchased the Dell G15 5520 Gaming Laptop, and I must say, it is an absolute powerhouse. Equipped with an Intel i5-12500H processor, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and a 512GB SSD, this laptop delivers an ultimate gaming experience. The NVIDIA RTX 3050 (4GB GDDR6) graphics card ensures smooth and immersive gameplay, making every session a visual treat.

The 15.6" FHD WVA AG 120Hz display with 250 nits of brightness provides superb screen quality, perfect for both gaming and multimedia consumption. The vibrant colors and sharp details enhance the overall visual experience. The backlit keyboard with an orange hue adds a stylish touch, making it a pleasure to use even in low-light conditions.

Despite its many strengths, the laptop does have one notable drawback—the battery life. Given its substantial weight and heavy-duty battery, I expected it to last at least three hours on a single charge. However, I was disappointed to find that the battery life only allows for about half an hour of gaming. This short battery life can be a significant inconvenience, especially for gamers who enjoy long sessions without being tethered to a power outlet.

Aside from the battery issue, my experience with the Dell G15 5520 has been excellent. The laptop's performance, screen quality, and overall build make it a fantastic choice for gamers and power users alike. The combination of Windows 11 and Microsoft Office 2021 adds to its appeal, providing a seamless and efficient user experience.

In summary:

Performance: Top-notch gaming performance with Intel i5-12500H, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and NVIDIA RTX 3050.

Display: Superb screen quality with a 15.6" FHD WVA AG 120Hz display.

Design: Stylish backlit keyboard and robust build quality.

Battery Life: Short battery life, only around 30 minutes of gaming on a single charge.

Overall Experience: Despite the battery issue, an excellent gaming laptop.

Overall, the Dell G15 5520 Gaming Laptop offers a great experience, provided you're prepared to deal with its limited battery life. If you're primarily using it in a stationary setup, this laptop will undoubtedly serve you well.
